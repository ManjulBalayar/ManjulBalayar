## 🔥 About Me
- 🎓 **Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence @ Iowa State University**  
- 🤖 Passionate about **Machine Learning, NLP, Deep Learning, and real-world AI systems**  
- 🛠 Recently been trying to **build things from scratch** — tools, pipelines, small products, experiments  
- 📈 Interested in **automation, XAI, efficient ML systems, and data-driven decision making**  
- 🥊 Outside tech: boxing, soccer, anime, music, and trying new cuisines

## 🧠 What I'm Working On/Worked on
### **🧬 seqSENSER**
- Real-time nanopore sequencing analysis and visualization pipeline
- Architected snapshot-based incremental processing to enable efficient real-time analysis of streaming nanopore data without reprocessing previously analyzed files
- Created real-time interactive Plotly dashboard with multi-barcode visualizations (quality distributions, coverage plots, mapping statistics) and real-time updates

### **📶 TextBench**
- Benchmarks and compares different NLP approaches for text analysis. Project inspired by my first NLP couse @ ISU (5790).
- Comparing rule-based techniques (regex tokenization), transformer models (BERT), and LLMs for sentiment analysis, topic classification, and summarization.
- Check the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and complexity across these different methods with visualizations.

### **📁 DriveFlow**
- Auto-renames, organizes, and tags documents  
- PaddleOCR + Llama 3.1B pipeline, built for 50–100+ client firms  
- Hardware + SaaS hybrid MVP

### **🔍 Explainable AI for Source Code**
- Analyzing neuron activations in code-trained LLMs  
- Clustering learned concepts  
- Working on visualization + interpretability tools
